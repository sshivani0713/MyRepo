public class Algorithms {

	//An algorithm is step by step method of accomplishing a distinct task. when a programmer writes
	//they need to identify which part should come first and which should come later and algorithms 
	//help them have clarity and saves time. Moreover they require a well organized way to store data 
	//that can be easily accessed to drive output as per user requirement.
	//examples of algorithm -- bubble merge and quick sort -- arrange num in asc/desc
	//examples of data structure -- binary tree/ hashtable/ graphs
	
	
	//A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed or modified officially.
